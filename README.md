# ML ZoomCamp Tasks Cohorts 2024

Welcome to my repository for the ML Zoomcamp course! This repository contains tasks and projects I completed as part of my learning journey in the course.

## About ML Zoomcamp

The ML Zoomcamp is a comprehensive 4-month course designed to teach Machine Learning Engineering through hands-on learning. The course covers a wide range of topics, including:

- **Linear Regression**: Feature engineering, categorical variables, regularization
- **Classification**: Logistic regression, feature importance, training with scikit-learn
- **Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning**: Gradient boosting, XGBoost
- **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**: CNNs, transfer learning, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Deploying Machine Learning Models**: Saving and loading models, Flask, Pipenv, Docker
- **Serverless Deep Learning**: AWS Lambda, TensorFlow Lite, Docker
- **Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving**
- **KServe (optional)**
